        <item>Making the Lipsus solution an integral part of your facility’s post-surgery procedure is a continued step towards excelling in patient-centered care.\n\n​

In past decades we have witnessed unprecedented advances in all areas of the medical field. However, for one specific area of patient well-being and quality of life after surgery under general anesthesia, time has stood still. Due to the prohibition to drink water after such surgeries, recovering patients suffer greatly from dry, cracked lips.\n\n​

The current method of using wet gauze pads to relieve patients of this pain is primitive and requires constant support by staff or family, who, in addition, are not always immediately available to assist.\n\n

​Approximately 400 million surgeries under general anesthesia are performed around the world yearly. 59% of the patients of these surgeries will suffer from dry, cracked lips at a level 7 ranking (‘very intense’) on the pain scale from 0 to 10.</item>
